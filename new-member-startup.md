# New Member Startup

## What is Discord?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDoCmDUpGbY

## The Categories

Discord is broken up into categories and channels. Each individual channel is grouped into a category. You should generally have your alerts on for the **Important** category and adjust the rest to your liking \(right click and mute on either the channel or category\).

## IMPORTANT CATEGORY

#### _The IMPORTANT Category houses information that should be at the forefront of your mind, ranging from announcements to auto-checkouts._ 

#### _Please NEVER CHAT OR LEAVE COMMENTS IN THESE CATEGORIES._   \#ANNOUNCEMENTS

* General announcements made by moderators about important info, group updates, and timed warnings about releases.

#### \#STAFF-IMPORTANT

* Announcements made by staff members. 

#### \#LINKS

* Links provided by members, typically used for sudden releases or products members should go for.
* Be wary of links posted by regular members \(purple/orange names\) as they have not been approved by staff members. Use your best judgement or ask in \#chat for more information.

#### \#INSTORE-INFO

* Important information regarding in-store releases and announcements. 

#### \#INSIDER-INFO

* Insider information \(stock numbers, release dates, news\) provided by Glaus \(glausangeles\#2497\).

#### \#GROUPBUYS

* Software/products that we have been given exclusive access to by a company.
* Stock is usually limited and release methods vary from FCFS \(First Come First Serve\) to Raffles.

#### \#GIVEAWAYS

* Giveaways hosted by members and staff. Please read what the giveaway is for as some may be free while others may require payment for the item. 

#### \#DAILY-SCHEDULE

* The daily gist of the day.

#### \#AUTO-CHECKOUT

* Auto-Checkouts \(ATC\) are slots provided by staff members and members with the "slot provider" role. These are all trusted individuals who attempt to purchase the selected item if you fill out their form accordingly.
* PAS \(Pay After Success\) means upon a successful checkout of the slot, you pay a fee to the slot provider. You will either be charged immediately or will be contacted soon by the provider.
* Please abide by each provider's terms of services. Failure to do so will result in you being banned from the provider's slots and possibly others as well. Be respectful as these services are not easy nor cheap to run.

## RELEASES CATEGORY

_**The RELEASES Category contains information about current or upcoming releases. Everything you need to know about them should be posted here.**_  
  
**\#JULY2ND-GYMRERD14S \(EXAMPLE\)**

* This is an example channel for the release of Air Jordan 14 Retro 'Gym Red' on July 2nd. All sneaker releases should follow a similar format.
* Prices, release dates, style codes, stock, and risk factors will be listed here along with some personal insight and updates from staff members like edog \(edog10090\#5318\).
* A release schedule with times for the release will follow. 
* More in-depth release guides may be posted by Trap \(TRAPHiC\#0033\).
* Please read the channel before asking questions about a release.

**\#AMERICA**

* A raffle channel specified for American users.
* Certain releases with low stock numbers, like Nike SB Dunks, may be difficult to acquire manually. Attempt to enter raffles for these limited releases as you may get lucky. 
* Be wary of certain raffles as they may take your money as a pending charge and will release it upon the day of results \(ie. Hanon, SlamJam\).

**\#RELEASE-CALENDAR**

* Similar to \#daily-schedule, an overview of expected releases will be posted here weekly and monthly.

**\#FLIPS & \#COSMOS-FLIPS**

* Channels dedicated to releases outside of shoes that may be profitable.

**\#CARDS-IMPORTANT**

* Channel dedicated to profitable sports card releases with Brick \(BRICK\#0002\) as the head of the pack. 

**\#SUPREME-DROPS**

* Supreme, popular skateboarding shop and clothing brand, typically releases in-stores and online every Thursday at 11AM EST. Potential items to go will be posted here by Owangie \(owangatang\#2020\).

**\#TICKET-EVENTS**

* Channels dedicated to profitable ticket releases. 

**\#DEALS**

* Miscellaneous deals provided by Rios \(Rios\#0001\), ranging from free items to potential flips.

**\#BRICKSEEK**

* Channels dedicated to discounted items that can be found by YoungMessy \(YoungMessy\#1829\) that can be found in-store by Brickseek.
* Be cautious when using Brickseek as actual stock information may not be 100% accurate. Travel to these locations with this in mind and don't be afraid to ask for representatives to check the backroom for these items if you cannot find them on display. 

**\#KITH-INFO**

* Kith, popular New York retailer, releases online through their Kith Monday Program every Monday at 11AM EST. Potential items to go for will be posted here by staff members.
